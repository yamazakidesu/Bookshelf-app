Project Description: Book Management Application

The Book Management Application is a simple yet practical mini project designed to help users organize and manage their personal book collection. This application provides essential features that allow users to:

Add New Books – Users can input and store important details of each book, including the title, author, and year of publication.

Track Reading Status – Users can categorize their books into two lists: completed (books that have been read) and in-progress (books yet to be finished).

Search Functionality – Users can quickly find books within their collection by searching based on specific keywords, such as the book title or author.

With a clean and user-friendly interface, this project demonstrates core functionality in data handling and user interaction. It serves as an excellent example of applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional web-based application.
