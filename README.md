Project Description: Book Management Web Application

The Book Management Web Application is a simple yet functional system designed to help users organize and manage their personal book collections. The application provides an intuitive interface that allows users to perform the following key tasks:

Add Books – Users can add new books by entering essential details such as the book title, author, and year of publication.

Track Reading Status – Books can be categorized into two lists: Completed (books that have been read) and Uncompleted (books that are still pending). This feature helps users monitor their reading progress effectively.

Search Functionality – The application includes a search feature that enables users to quickly find specific books within their collection by title.

With a clean design and user-friendly features, this application provides a practical solution for readers who want to digitally manage their book lists. It can be extended with additional functionalities such as editing book details, deleting entries, or integrating cloud storage for persistent data management.
